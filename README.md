TASK 3: DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DeFi) SMART CONTRACT (500+ WORDS)
Task 3 focused on developing a simple decentralized finance (DeFi) application using Solidity. DeFi applications aim to provide financial services such as lending and borrowing without relying on centralized institutions. The objective of this task was to understand how financial logic can be implemented securely using smart contracts.
A smart contract named SimpleDeFi was created to allow users to deposit ETH, borrow funds, repay loans, and check contract balance. Solidity mappings were used to track user deposits and loan amounts. Payable functions were implemented to handle ETH transactions securely.
The contract logic ensured that users could only borrow funds if sufficient liquidity was available in the contract. Interest calculation was added to demonstrate real-world lending behavior. Require statements were used extensively to prevent invalid operations, ensuring contract security.
The contract was compiled and deployed using Remix IDE with the Remix VM environment. During deployment, care was taken not to send ETH to non-payable functions, avoiding common deployment errors. After deployment, all functions were tested individually.
The deposit function allowed users to send ETH into the contract. The borrow function transferred ETH to the borrower while recording loan details. The repay function ensured that loans were cleared only when sufficient repayment was made. The contractBalance function helped verify the internal balance of the contract.
This task clearly demonstrated how DeFi eliminates intermediaries and automates financial operations using blockchain technology. It provided real-world exposure to decentralized applications and strengthened understanding of Ethereum-based finance systems.
